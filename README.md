# Cell-Simulation

## Project Description

This is Momentum Test Universe. Modeled with classical mechanics, linear momentum. Try to analyse special tactics to survive in a mass velocity driven universe.

Momentum

In classical mechanics, linear momentum or translational momentum (pl. momenta; SI unit kg m/s, or equivalently, N s) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. For example, a heavy truck moving rapidly has a large momentumâ€”it takes a large or prolonged force to get the truck up to this speed, and it takes a large or prolonged force to bring it to a stop afterwards. If the truck were lighter, or moving more slowly, then it would have less momentum.

Like velocity, linear momentum is a vector quantity, possessing a direction as well as a magnitude:

p = m x v

Linear momentum is also a conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change. In classical mechanics, conservation of linear momentum is implied by Newton's laws; but it also holds in special relativity (with a modified formula) and, with appropriate definitions, a (generalized) linear momentum conservation law holds in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity.
Simulation Idea

The idea is simple. I am trying to define a basic universe and analyse predefined financial tactics for companies.
Universe is modeled according to rules of the momentum.
Any ball hits other the momentum will be preserved m1v1=m2v2
The small ball will join to the big ball. Big eats small. The joint new ball's equation will be m x v = m1 x v1 + m2 x v2.
At the and of the simulation the biggest mass will dominate the universe. If any ball reaches a mass bigger than the sum of all other objects (bigger than the half of the total universes mass) will dominate the universe.
Every white balls are dummy mass in the universe.
Every green ball are smart mass in the universe. The are dropping mass for movement in the universe according to their predefined tactics.
- Catch Small: Tries to catch smallest object in the universe
- Evade Big: Tries to evade biggest object in the universe
- No Speed: Tries to stay still in the universe.
- CatchNearest: Tries to catch nearest object which is smaller than himself.
- CatchSlow: Tries to catch slowest object which is smaller than himself.
- CatchFast: Tries to catch fastest object which is smaller than himself.
- CatchSmallAndEvadeBig: In one turn Catch Small and other turn evade big.
- CatchNearestAndEvadeBig: In one turn Catch Nearest and other turn evade big.- FollowBig : Follow the biggest object without touching it.
- Matador : Evade big objects that coming towards it like a matador.
- CatchMomentum: Tries to catch object with highest momentum which is smaller than himself.
